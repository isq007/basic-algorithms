Solutions

Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers

solution : 

	start
        input a number n
	initialize sum=0
	loop from i=1 to n
	   add i to sum
	display the sum
        end

Problem 2: Check for Prime Number

solution:
	
	start	
	input a number n
	if n is less than 2 print "Not a prime number" and stop
	loop from i=2 to âˆšn 
	 if n is divisible by i, print "Not a prime number" and stop
	if no divisors are sound, print "Prime number"
	end

Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers
solution:


        Start
        Input three numbers: a, b, and c
 	If a is greater than or equal to b and a is greater than or equal to c, then a is 	the largest
	Else if b is greater than or equal to a and b is greater than or equal to c, then b 	is the largest
	Else, c is the largest
	Print the largest number
	End

solution:

	Start
	Input a number n
	If n % 2 == 0, print "Even"
